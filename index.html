      <p>Greetings, I'm Scott, a passionate tech enthusiast and software developer based in Chester, UK.

        With recently receiving a BSc in Computer Science, I was able to hone my abilities in system design, time management, and software development to develop this portfolio. 
        Working on a variety of projects during my time in college, both alone and with others, also helped challenge my imagination and advanced my development skills.</p>

    <h3>Dissertation Project </h3>
    <p>This project was designed, developed and tested for my dissertation project in university.
      <br><br>
      The hypothesis for this project was to examine the effectiveness of gamification in educational materials for undergraduate computing students with earlier research indicating that learning computer programming is difficult and may lead to high dropout rate (Dirzyte et al, 2023).
      <br><br>
      Software such as Figma, Miro, Visual Studio and SQL were used to design the fundamental layout and features and to store data from users and track their achievements.

    <h3>Project Management System </h3>
    <p>As part of a group project at university, we developed a web application that allowed students to submit and rank their dissertation topic preferences, from most to least preferred. 
      <br> <br>The platform aimed to streamline the topic selection process for both students and academic staff. I contributed to both the design and development phases, using Figma to create user-friendly interface mockups, Visual Studio Code for front-end implementation, and Visual Studio for back-end development. 
      <br> <br> This project was able to strengthen my skills in collaborative development, UI/UX design, and full-stack web technologies.</p>

    <h3>Nutrition App</h3>
    <p> My group that consisted of 6 members developed a interactive mobile app prototype aimed for nutritionally conscious shoppers. The app had to provide 'stickiness', usability and accesibility quality. 
      <br> <br>
      The key objectives included the following:
      <br> 
    - Create a delightful, usable and accessible user interface with 'simple' at its core.
    <br>
    - Make the app 'sticky' and engaging - so users keep coming back.
    <br>
    - Additional features are encouraged, if time allows in the project timeline.
    <br> <br>
    This project allowed me to develop my skills in Figma, teamwork and user experience design.</p>

    <h3>Workout App </h3>
    <p>During my spare time, I developed a small workout app that allowed users to view exercises in categories such as 'cardio', 'strength' and 'flexibility'. The app would provide a image of each exercise and a description. The app also was enabled to time a specific exercise and provide a notification when the time was up.
      <br> <br>Doing this small project allowed me to further develop my skills in Kotlin, Android Studio and UI/UX design. I also had to use GitHub to manage the project and ensure that I had a backup of the project at all times.
    <br><br> Please note that this project is not fully complete and is still a work in progress.</p>
